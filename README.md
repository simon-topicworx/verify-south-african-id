# Verify a South African Identity Number:
This form takes a valid 13 digit input and outputs the following:<br/>
`ID : Female/Male : Citezen/Permanent Residence : Date of Birth(d-mm-yyyy)`<br/>
<br/>
The date of birth `yyyy` output only works for people less than 100 years old. (ID validation still works for people 100 and older)<br/>
<br/>
